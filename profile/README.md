# Welcome

Welcome to the public Github for alphaweighted.  Hosted here are various components for integrating with
services at alphaweighted.com, and a-la-carte modules and utilities for building and running your own
backtesting and trading infrastructure.

These tools are aimed at systematic/algorithmic traders, as well as discretionary traders and investors using
automation tooling to help with research, planning or execution.

They are built and provided under two key philosophies:

1. That **no single platform can provide all the power/flexibility/choice** for you to explore, test and express your strategies -> so they are provided 'a-la-carte'; use the components that are relevant to you and build the rest yourself
2. **Your strategies are your secret sauce** and must be provably confidential on your own infrastructure.  All components include documentation describing how to configure for and verify security, so you can be confident no secrets get leaked.
